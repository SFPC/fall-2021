                          Proof of vaccination dated before July 10th is a requirement to participate in this class. It is deeply important for this session (SFPC‚Äôs first in-person session in more than a year!) that we all keep each other safe when we meet. If you are not vaccinated; protect your safety and the safety of others by joining one of our summer online classes.

                          If you can‚Äôt pay full tuition, we really still want you to apply. Our application will ask you how much you can pay. We will offer up to  4 subsidized positions in all of our classes, once each one has enough students enrolled that we‚Äôre able to do so. We have also started a <a href="https://withfriends.co/school_for_poetic_computation/join">scholarship fund</a>, and we will be offering additional scholarships as community members
                          <a href="https://withfriends.co/school_for_poetic_computation/join">redistribute their wealth through SFPC</a>. We direct scholarship funds towards students who are Black, Indigenous, racialized, gendered, disabled, Queer, trans, underrepresented, oppressed and minoritized.
                        <br><BR>
                          Right now, tuition is SFPC‚Äôs main source of income, and that is a problem. It means that we can only pay teachers, pay for space, and organize events and classes when students pay full tuition to attend. Tuition is a huge barrier to entry into the SFPC community, and it disproportionately limits Black students, indigenous students, queer and trans students, and other people who are marginalized, from participating. Scholarships are not a long term solution for us, but in the short and medium term we hope to offer them more while we work towards transforming SFPC‚Äôs financial model.

                          For SFPC to be the kind of place the community has always meant it to be, it needs to become a platform for wealth redistribution. If you are a former student, prospective student, or friend of the school, and you have the financial privilege to do so, <a href="https://withfriends.co/school_for_poetic_computation/join">please donate generously</a>. There is enough wealth in this community to make sure no one is ever rejected because of their inability to pay, and becoming that school will make SFPC the impactful, imaginative, transformative center of poetry and justice that we know it can be.
