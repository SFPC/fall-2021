                          Proof of vaccination dated before July 10th is a requirement to participate in this class. It is deeply important for this session (SFPC’s first in-person session in more than a year!) that we all keep each other safe when we meet. If you are not vaccinated; protect your safety and the safety of others by joining one of our summer online classes.

                          <p>We will not require participants to wear masks during class, which will be held inside with ventilation at <a href="https://www.primeproduce.coop/" target="_blank">Prime Produce</a>. You are welcome to wear a mask if you choose!

                            We offer scholarships for those who cannot pay full tuition. Read more about scholarships below.

                          If you can’t pay full tuition, we really still want you to apply. Our application will ask you how much you can pay. We will offer up to  4 subsidized positions in all of our classes, once each one has enough students enrolled that we’re able to do so. We have also started a <a href="https://withfriends.co/school_for_poetic_computation/join">scholarship fund</a>, and we will be offering additional scholarships as community members
                          <a href="https://withfriends.co/school_for_poetic_computation/join">redistribute their wealth through SFPC</a>. We direct scholarship funds towards students who are Black, Indigenous, racialized, gendered, disabled, Queer, trans, underrepresented, oppressed and minoritized.
                        <br><BR>
                          Right now, tuition is SFPC’s main source of income, and that is a problem. It means that we can only pay teachers, pay for space, and organize events and classes when students pay full tuition to attend. Tuition is a huge barrier to entry into the SFPC community, and it disproportionately limits Black students, indigenous students, queer and trans students, and other people who are marginalized, from participating. Scholarships are not a long term solution for us, but in the short and medium term we hope to offer them more while we work towards transforming SFPC’s financial model.

                        <p>
                          For SFPC to be the kind of place the community has always meant it to be, it needs to become a platform for wealth redistribution. If you are a former student, prospective student, or friend of the school, and you have the financial privilege to do so, <a href="https://withfriends.co/school_for_poetic_computation/join">please donate generously</a>. There is enough wealth in this community to make sure no one is ever rejected because of their inability to pay, and becoming that school will make SFPC the impactful, imaginative, transformative center of poetry and justice that we know it can be.

                        The School for Poetic Computation is changing.
                        This summer, we are making a temporary space together in a <span class="cocoon-inline">COCOON</span>. We invite you into our collective studies as we work towards an experimental curriculum that can grow and transform over time. We will learn to unlearn with others in order to change the conditions of learning itself. We are making new schooling formations that facilitate the oscillation between teacher and student. Not yet flying, we invite you to wrap yourselves in the warm, gooey muck of becoming in the shedding over and over again.
